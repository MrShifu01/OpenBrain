# Month 1–2 Sprint — Retention & Sharing (Weeks 4–8)

**Goal:** Prove the habit loop works and start the viral flywheel. Watch the PostHog funnel every morning.

## Metrics to Hit Before Moving On

- Day 7 retention ≥ 25%
- Free → Starter conversion ≥ 3%
- Weekly active users (WAU) growing week-over-week
- < 5% churn in first billing cycle

## Features to Build

- [ ] **Shareable Insight Cards.**
  - "Share this insight" button on AI responses.
  - OG-image-ready card (quote + brain logo + `everion.app`).
  - Copy-to-clipboard + direct share to X, LinkedIn, WhatsApp.
  - This is your organic acquisition engine. Users share AI insights that make them look smart.

- [ ] **Weekly Email Digest.**
  - Sunday evening: "Your brain this week — 12 captures, 3 patterns, 1 action suggested."
  - Links back to the Feed. Reactivates dormant users.
  - Use Resend (already integrated for brain invites).

- [ ] **Push Notifications (streak reminders).**
  - "Don't break your 7-day streak. What's on your mind?"
  - Respect quiet hours. Dismissible. Opt-out in Settings.

- [ ] **Chat Feedback v1** (see `chat-feedback-system.md`).
  - Thumbs up/down on every AI response.
  - Table: `chat_feedback` with question embedding.
  - Feeds into few-shot injection on next chat (top-3 similar thumbs-up examples).
  - Also feeds Layer 1 of `prompt-self-improvement.md`.

- [ ] **Prompt Improvement Layer 1** (see `prompt-self-improvement.md`).
  - Review thumbs-down responses weekly. Edit CAPTURE and CHAT prompts based on actual failure modes.
  - Pull entries with `type: "note"` — classification failures.
