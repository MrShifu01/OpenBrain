> **HARD LIMIT — Vercel Hobby plan: max 12 serverless functions.**
> The project is at exactly 12 `api/*.ts` files — the maximum allowed.
> **Never create a new top-level file in `api/` without first consolidating an existing endpoint.**
> Route new actions through an existing handler using `?resource=` or `?action=` query params instead.
> Current functions (12): calendar, capture, entries, feedback, gmail, llm, mcp, memory-api, search, transfer, user-data, v1

Behavioral guidelines to reduce common LLM coding mistakes. Merge with project-specific instructions as needed.

**Tradeoff:** These guidelines bias toward caution over speed. For trivial tasks, use judgment.

## 1. Think Before Coding

**Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.**

Before implementing:
- State your assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them - don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.

## 2. Simplicity First

**Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.**

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.

Ask yourself: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?" If yes, simplify.

## 3. Surgical Changes

**Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.**

When editing existing code:
- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it - don't delete it.

When your changes create orphans:
- Remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes made unused.
- Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.

The test: Every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

## 4. Goal-Driven Execution

**Define success criteria. Loop until verified.**

Transform tasks into verifiable goals:
- "Add validation" → "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass"
- "Fix the bug" → "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass"
- "Refactor X" → "Ensure tests pass before and after"

For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan:
```
1. [Step] → verify: [check]
2. [Step] → verify: [check]
3. [Step] → verify: [check]
```

Strong success criteria let you loop independently. Weak criteria ("make it work") require constant clarification.

---

**These guidelines are working if:** fewer unnecessary changes in diffs, fewer rewrites due to overcomplication, and clarifying questions come before implementation rather than after mistakes.

## Self-Debugging Access

When the user reports an error or asks to investigate a problem, use these resources directly before asking for more details.

### Supabase (project: `wfvoqpdfzkqnenzjxhui`)
Use `mcp__claude_ai_Supabase__*` tools:
- **SQL queries**: `execute_sql` — check schema, row counts, RLS policies, missing columns
- **API logs** (last 24h): `get_logs` with `service: "api"` — see all HTTP calls including failed PostgREST queries, auth failures, 4xx/5xx errors
- **Auth logs**: `get_logs` with `service: "auth"`
- **Postgres logs**: `get_logs` with `service: "postgres"`
- **Apply migrations**: `apply_migration` for DDL changes

Key facts:
- Service role key bypasses RLS; Vercel functions use it (node user-agent in logs)
- Browser SDK calls show as iPhone/Chrome Safari user-agents
- `entry_brains` and `audit_log` tables do NOT exist — errors from them are expected/silent
- `user_usage` has no row for new billing periods → 406 on `.single()` (fixed with `.maybeSingle()`)

### Vercel
Use `mcp__plugin_vercel_vercel__authenticate` to start OAuth if not already authenticated.
- Function logs show errors from serverless functions
- 12-function hard limit — never add a new `api/*.ts` file
- Rewrites in `vercel.json` map `/api/brains` → `/api/user-data?resource=brains`, etc.

### GitHub
Use `Bash` with `gh` CLI:
- `gh run list` — recent CI runs
- `gh run view <id>` — check failed steps
- `gh pr list` / `gh pr view` — PRs

## graphify

This project has a graphify knowledge graph at graphify-out/.

Rules:
- Before answering architecture or codebase questions, read graphify-out/GRAPH_REPORT.md for god nodes and community structure
- If graphify-out/wiki/index.md exists, navigate it instead of reading raw files
- After modifying code files in this session, run `python3 -c "from graphify.watch import _rebuild_code; from pathlib import Path; _rebuild_code(Path('.'))"` to keep the graph current
