// ============================================================
// Single source of truth for "is this entry enriched?".
// ============================================================
//
// Used by:
//   - the inline pipeline (decides which steps to run)
//   - the diagnostic endpoint (counts pending / done)
//   - the EntryList card chips (P/I/C/E indicators)
//   - the wave-dot heuristic (isPending)
//
// Rules:
//   - Explicit booleans only. No fallback heuristics — if a flag
//     isn't `true`, the step needs to run.
//   - Legacy data is stamped explicitly via migration 045 before this
//     module replaces the old isParsed/hasInsight/hasConcepts helpers.
//   - Embedding lives on its own column path, not inside metadata.
//     `embedded` is true when embedding_status='done' OR embedded_at
//     is non-null.
