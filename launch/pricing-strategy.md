## Platform AI Usage Limits

| Action             | Free (BYOK)         | Starter  | Pro        |
| ------------------ | ------------------- | -------- | ---------- |
| AI-parsed captures | unlimited (own key) | 500 / mo | 2 000 / mo |
| AI chats           | unlimited (own key) | 200 / mo | 1 000 / mo |

| -------------------------- | --------- | -------------- | ---------- |
| AI capture (parse + embed) | ~$0.0004  | ~85%           | ~88%       |

Blended gross margin target: **85%+**

## Upgrade Trigger Points

- At **100%** of any limit: action blocked, upgrade modal shown
- Modal always includes "Use your own API key instead" escape hatch

## Data Architecture

Tier is stored in `user_profiles.tier` (source of truth). `user_ai_settings.plan` is kept in sync via a DB trigger during the transition period and will be removed once all reads migrate to `user_profiles`. See design spec for full schema.

## Stripe Products

| Product         | Stripe Price ID env var          |
| --------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Starter monthly | `STRIPE_STARTER_PRICE_ID`        |
| Pro monthly     | `STRIPE_PRO_PRICE_ID`            |
| Starter annual  | `STRIPE_STARTER_ANNUAL_PRICE_ID` |
| Pro annual      | `STRIPE_PRO_ANNUAL_PRICE_ID`     |

## Key Decisions & Rationale

**Why BYOK on Free?**
Lowers the barrier to zero for technical users. They get full AI without paying, but they manage their own keys and costs. This drives signups and word-of-mouth in the developer/PKM audience. Paid tiers sell convenience + model quality, not capability.

**Why 3 tiers not 2?**
$4.99 Starter captures users who want platform AI but won't pay $9.99 at launch. Lower entry point = higher conversion. Starter → Pro upsell happens naturally as power users hit limits or want better models.

**Why hosted Checkout (not embedded)?**
Fastest to ship, highest conversion, zero PCI scope. Stripe's hosted page handles 3DS, SCA, tax, card validation. Revisit embedded Elements only if brand consistency becomes a hard requirement post-launch.

**Grace period on cancellation**
`tier_expires_at` is set to `current_period_end` on `subscription.deleted`. Users retain access until the period they paid for ends — no surprise access loss, reduces support tickets.
