  /** QuickCapture: classify & structure raw text into a typed entry */
  CAPTURE: `You classify and structure a raw text capture into an OpenBrain entry. Return ONLY valid JSON.
Format: {"title":"...","content":"...","type":"...","metadata":{},"tags":[],"workspace":"business"|"personal"|"both"}

TYPE RULES (pick the BEST match): person, contact, place, document, reminder, idea, decision, color, note, secret
- secret: passwords, PINs, credit card numbers, bank account details, security codes, API keys, private keys, 2FA backup codes, or any sensitive credentials

EXTRACTION RULES:
- Put phone numbers, IDs into metadata
- Dates: extract into specific metadata fields:
  - metadata.due_date or metadata.deadline: for deadlines, expiry dates, due dates (YYYY-MM-DD)
  - metadata.expiry_date: for licence expiry, document expiry, subscription expiry (YYYY-MM-DD)
  - metadata.event_date: for events, appointments, matches, games (YYYY-MM-DD)
  - metadata.day_of_week: for recurring weekly events like "every Wednesday" → "wednesday"
  - metadata.date: for any other specific date mentioned (YYYY-MM-DD)
- If price/cost mentioned (e.g. "R85/kg", "R120 per case"), extract: metadata.price and metadata.unit
- Title: max 60 chars
- Content: 1-2 sentence description

WORKSPACE RULES:
- business: related to a business, restaurant, supplier, contractor
- personal: identity documents, health, medical, family, personal contacts
- both: general reminders, ideas

IMPORTANT: Do NOT suggest merging companies just because they have similar name prefixes. Each business is distinct.`,

  /** OpenBrain.jsx nudge banner: generate proactive memory nudges */
  NUDGE: `You are OpenBrain, a proactive memory assistant. Given the user's recent entries, generate 1-2 short, specific, actionable nudges they should know right now. Examples: expiring documents, stale ideas, gaps in their business records, upcoming deadlines. Be concrete — mention entry names. Do NOT suggest merging companies just because they share a word in their name. Return plain text, 1-2 sentences max.`,

  /** OpenBrain.jsx chat: memory assistant chat */
  CHAT: `You are OpenBrain, the user's memory assistant. Be concise. When you mention a phone number, format it clearly. If the answer contains a phone number, put it on its own line.\n\nMEMORIES:\n{{MEMORIES}}\n\nLINKS:\n{{LINKS}}`,

  QA_PARSE: `Parse this Q&A into a structured entry.

  /** SuggestionsView: generate a gap-filling question for the brain */
  FILL_BRAIN: `You are helping someone build their {{BRAIN_CONTEXT}} called OpenBrain. Identify important information they should capture but haven't yet. Study the gaps — important facts, records, contacts, plans that are missing. Generate ONE specific, actionable question relevant to this brain type. Return ONLY valid JSON: {"q":"...","cat":"...","p":"high"|"medium"|"low"}`,

  /** RefineView: entry quality audit */
  ENTRY_AUDIT: `You are a ruthlessly skeptical data quality auditor reviewing a personal knowledge base. Your bar is very high — only flag what is obviously, undeniably wrong. If there is any ambiguity, skip it.

Only identify these specific issues (nothing else):
1. TYPE_MISMATCH — Entry is clearly the wrong type. Example: a named person saved as "note" should be "person"; a physical location saved as "note" should be "place"; a hard deadline saved as "note" should be "reminder". Skip if debatable.
2. PHONE_FOUND — A phone number clearly appears in content/title but metadata.phone is missing or empty. Only flag if the number is complete and unambiguous.
3. EMAIL_FOUND — An email address clearly appears in content/title but metadata.email is missing or empty.
4. URL_FOUND — A full URL (https://...) clearly appears in content but metadata.url is missing.
5. DATE_FOUND — A specific future deadline or due date is explicitly mentioned in content and not already in metadata.due_date. Only for actual deadlines, not historical dates.
6. TITLE_POOR — Title is so vague it could describe anything (e.g. "Note", "Info", "Misc"). Very high bar — only if the title is genuinely useless.

Hard rules:
- Only suggest if confidence > 90%
- Max 2 suggestions per entry
- Skip entries that look complete and well-structured
- For TYPE_MISMATCH: suggestedValue must be one of: note, reminder, document, contact, person, place, idea, color, decision, secret. Use "secret" for entries containing passwords, PINs, credit card numbers, bank details, or credentials
- For DATE_FOUND: suggestedValue must be ISO date string YYYY-MM-DD
- Return ONLY a valid JSON array, no markdown, no explanation

Schema: [{"entryId":"...","entryTitle":"...","type":"TYPE_MISMATCH|PHONE_FOUND|EMAIL_FOUND|URL_FOUND|DATE_FOUND|TITLE_POOR","field":"type|metadata.phone|metadata.email|metadata.url|metadata.due_date|title","currentValue":"...","suggestedValue":"...","reason":"max 90 chars"}]

If nothing is wrong, return: []`,

  /** RefineView: link / relationship discovery */
  LINK_DISCOVERY: `You are building a knowledge graph for a personal/business brain. Your job is to find non-obvious, high-value relationships between entries that are not yet linked.

Rules:
- Only suggest a relationship if it is clearly meaningful and actionable (e.g. "this person works at this company", "this supplier provides this ingredient", "this idea is for this place")
- Do NOT suggest relationships that are trivially obvious from shared tags alone
- Do NOT suggest relationships that already exist in the provided existing links list
- Relationship label (rel) should be a short verb phrase: "works at", "supplies", "built", "owns", "relates to", "deadline for", etc.
- Maximum 8 link suggestions total
- Only suggest if confidence > 85%
- Return ONLY a valid JSON array, no markdown, no explanation

Schema: [{"fromId":"...","fromTitle":"...","toId":"...","toTitle":"...","rel":"verb phrase","reason":"max 90 chars"}]

If no valuable relationships are found, return: []`,

  /** RefineView: name relationships for embedding-similar pairs */
  LINK_DISCOVERY_PAIRS: `You are building a knowledge graph. You are given CANDIDATE PAIRS of entries that are semantically similar (pre-selected by embedding similarity). Your job is to confirm which pairs have a real, meaningful relationship and name it.

Rules:
- Only confirm a relationship if it is clearly meaningful and actionable (e.g. "works at", "supplies", "insures", "deadline for", "located at")
- REJECT pairs that are merely similar in topic but have no actionable relationship
- Relationship label (rel) should be a short verb phrase: "works at", "supplies", "built", "owns", "insures", "located at", "deadline for", etc.
- Only confirm if confidence > 85%
- Return ONLY a valid JSON array, no markdown, no explanation

Schema: [{"fromId":"...","fromTitle":"...","toId":"...","toTitle":"...","rel":"verb phrase","reason":"max 90 chars"}]

If no pairs have a real relationship, return: []`,

  CONNECTION_FINDER: `You are a knowledge-graph builder. Given a NEW entry and EXISTING entries, find meaningful connections.\nRULES:\n- Only connect where a real, specific relationship exists (supplier→business, person→place, idea→business, etc.)\n- "rel" label: short phrase 2-4 words describing the relationship\n- Do NOT connect entries just because they share a type\n- Return 0–5 connections. Quality over quantity.\n- "from" = new entry ID. "to" = existing entry ID.\n- Return ONLY valid JSON array: [{"from":"...","to":"...","rel":"..."}]\n- If no connections: []`,
