          Everion is as private as a notebook in your drawer — including the high-stakes stuff (IDs,

        <Section title="What we store" id="what-we-store">
          Of your content: your entries, your concepts, and the sync metadata they need. That's it —
          we don't analyze, mine, or sell what you wrote. We do not store your device ID or your IP
          address beyond 24 hours.
        </Section>

        <Section title="The vault — for high-stakes facts" id="vault">
          The vault is the part of Everion designed to hold the things you wouldn't write in a
          regular notes app: ID numbers, bank account details, gate codes, computer serial numbers,
          driver's licence info, policy numbers, "if something happens to me" notes, where the spare
          key is.
          <br />
          <br />
          Vault entries are encrypted on your device with a passphrase only you know.{" "}
          <strong>
            We never see the passphrase, and we cannot decrypt vault entries on our side.
          </strong>{" "}
          When you set up the vault, we generate a one-time recovery key and show it to you to write
          down. We store an encrypted blob of your vault key on our server — encrypted with that
          recovery key — so the only way it ever becomes useful is if <em>you</em> bring the
          recovery key back. Lose both the passphrase and the recovery key, and the vault is
          unrecoverable. Storing your bank details should not feel safer than storing them in
          1Password; this is built so it doesn't.
          <br />
          <br />
          Vault content is also kept out of the AI pipeline by default — embeddings and chat context
          use your normal entries, not vault entries, unless you explicitly opt-in for a specific
          vault entry.
        </Section>

        <Section title="End-to-end encryption" id="encryption">
          <strong>Algorithm:</strong> AES-GCM 256-bit, with keys derived from your passphrase via
          PBKDF2 (310,000 iterations, SHA-256, browser-native WebCrypto). Encryption and decryption
          happen inside your browser — the unencrypted plaintext of a vault entry never touches our
          servers.
          <br />
          <br />
          <strong>What we can see vs. can't:</strong> we can see that <em>you</em> have an entry
          (its row exists, its size, when it was created); we cannot see what's inside a vault
          entry. Regular (non-vault) entries are stored in our database in a form we can read — this
          is what enables search and AI chat. If something has to be vault-grade private, put it in
          the vault.
          <br />
          <br />
          <strong>Keys never leave your device unencrypted.</strong> The only key material that
          touches our server is the recovery blob (your vault key encrypted with your one-time
          recovery key). Without your recovery key, the blob is opaque to us. We get a lot of
          "please reset my vault" emails — and unless you still have your recovery key, we can't.
        </Section>

        <Section title="AI processing — exactly what is sent where" id="ai">
          <strong>Embeddings (search):</strong> when you create a regular entry, its text is sent to
          Google Gemini to produce an embedding vector. The embedding stays in our database; the
          text round-trip is one call, no training. Vault entries are not embedded by default.
          <br />
          <br />
          <strong>Chat (recall):</strong> when you ask your memory a question, the entries that
          match your question are sent — along with your question — to whichever AI provider you've
          configured. With your own API key, the request goes through your provider account, not
          ours. With the hosted Gemini option (Pro), the request goes through ours.
          <br />
          <br />
          <strong>What providers see:</strong> the entries relevant to your specific question, plus
          your question. Not your full memory, not your account, not metadata they don't need. Under
          our agreements with OpenAI, Anthropic, Groq, and Google, none of them train on your data.
          <br />
          <br />
          <strong>What providers don't see:</strong> vault content, your encryption keys, your
          unrelated entries.

          Your data is yours. From <em>Settings → Data</em> you can export:
          <ul style={{ margin: "12px 0 12px 20px", padding: 0 }}>
            <li>
              your entries as <strong>JSON</strong> or <strong>CSV</strong>

            </li>
          </ul>
          Vault entries are included in the full export as their original AES-GCM ciphertext. Our
          server cannot decrypt them — only your in-app vault, with your passphrase, can. Today the
          path back in is the app itself; a separate offline decryption tool is on the roadmap so
          your encrypted vault remains readable even if we vanish.
          <br />
          <br />
          We make this easy on purpose: the moment a privacy-first product can hold your data
          hostage, the privacy claim is empty.

        <Section title="Retention & deletion" id="retention">
          We keep your data while your account exists so the app can do its job. When you delete
          your account, every row we have of you is scrubbed within 48 hours, including embeddings,
          push subscriptions, and integration tokens. Vault entries — being encrypted — were already
          unreadable to us; we delete the ciphertext too.
