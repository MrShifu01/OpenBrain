          Plain English. If any of this needs a lawyer to explain, write to us and we'll fix it.
        </p>

        <Section title="The deal">
          We give you a room. You put things in it. You own those things. We help you find them.
        </Section>

        <Section title="Your account">
          One person per account. You're responsible for keeping your email secure. Magic links are
          disposable — we'll email a fresh one every time.
        </Section>

        <Section title="What you can't do">
          Nothing illegal. Nothing that tries to break our service for others. Nothing that's
          someone else's copyrighted material they haven't let you store. Nothing that would make us
          a courier for malware.
        </Section>

        <Section title="What we can't do">
          Read your vault. Sell your data. Train on your writing. Keep your data if you ask us not
          to.
        </Section>

        <Section title="Payments">
          Pro is month-to-month. Cancel any time. We refund partial months if you ask politely.
        </Section>

        <Section title="If we change these terms">
          We'll email you 30 days before anything material changes. Using Everion after that counts
          as acceptance. If you disagree, export and leave — we won't be offended.
        </Section>

        <Section title="Third parties">
          The app uses Supabase (database + auth, EU West region), Vercel (hosting), Resend
          (transactional email), Sentry (error monitoring, no PII), PostHog (analytics, only after
          you consent), and Google Gemini (embeddings + enrichment). When you chat with your memory,
          the AI provider you select handles the request. Your use is also subject to their terms.
        </Section>

        <Section title="AI output">
          Everion uses AI to summarize, enrich, link, and answer questions about your entries. AI
          can be wrong, biased, or out of date. Treat its output as a starting point, not a fact.
          Don't rely on it for medical, legal, financial, or safety-critical decisions without
          checking the source.
        </Section>

        <Section title="Governing law">
          These terms are governed by the laws of South Africa. Disputes that can't be resolved
          informally go to the courts of South Africa, unless local consumer-protection law gives
          you a different right.
        </Section>

        <Section title="As-is">
          The service is provided "as is" without warranty of any kind. We're not liable for loss of
          data or damages arising from use of the service. Export regularly.
